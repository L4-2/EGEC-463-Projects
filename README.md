# EGEC-463-Projects

Projects for: Current Topics in Computer Engineering: Networked Embedded Systems and Network-on-Chips

I just made this to keep my projects tidy and accessible where ever git is available.

I use an ESP32-PICO-D4 in the arduino ide and vscode in WSL2 for the pc side code. This should work for any other wifi enabled ESP32 board.
On the arduino ide side of things, get the driver for the ESP32 here: https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers and install it as a driver in device manager for the UART device.
